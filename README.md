## Meme Generator

Bonus project (*not mandatory*) developed during block 05, in which I studied the _DOM tree, events, and JavaScript storage_.

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. Users can _upload_ images from their device to the page;
2. There are 4 pre-selected images available in case the user wants to use them;
3. Clicking on the `fire`, `water`, `earth`, `dark` and `clear` buttons can change the border of the meme being created;
4. In the `input` area, you can type a text that will automatically appear over the meme image.
